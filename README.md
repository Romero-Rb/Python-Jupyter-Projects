# Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook

This is a repository to display my projects utilizing python with jupyter notebooks. Some of the projects I have done include the following:

Project Title  | Description   |  Topic
-------------- | ------------- | ------------------
[JAMB Score Analysis](https://github.com/Romero-Rb/Python-Jupyter-Projects/tree/main/JAMB%20Score%20Analysis) | Analyized the test provided by the Nigerian entrance examination board to determine what factors aided in the participant's success and the relationships present between those factors. | Data visualization, linear Regression, logistic Regression, sklearn , pandas, numpy , matplotlib, data manipulation
[Visa Stocks Analysis](https://github.com/Romero-Rb/Python-Jupyter-Projects/tree/main/Visa%20Stocks%20Multiple%20Linear%20Reg) |  Explored the data for Visa stocks from 2020-2024 utilizing multiple linear regression to analyze the outcomes of the final adjusted closing values | Multiple linear regression, sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, data visualization, data manipulation 
[House Pricing Analysis](https://github.com/Romero-Rb/Python-Jupyter-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Linear%20Reg) | Analyzed the house sale prices for King county between May 2014 and May 2015 to determine what factors had a strong correlation with the house sale price. This was used to aid me in understanding linear regression | Linear regression using sklearn, pandas, and numpy, data visualization, data manipulation
[Earthquake Analysis](https://github.com/Romero-Rb/Python-Jupyter-Projects/tree/main/Earthquake%20Analysis) | Visualized and analyzed the data regarding earthquakes from 1990 to 2023, answering serveal questions I posed. | Data cleaning, data vizualization with matplotlib and seaborn, data maniuplation utilizing pandas, data importing


## Data Visualization Examples
Here are some examples of data visualization from the JAMB Score Analysis project and Visa Stocks Analysis Project
